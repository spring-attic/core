=== `App Starters Security` Common Module

Spring Boot auto-configuration to manage the web security of the application starters.

When the `app-starters-security-common` dependency is on the classpath, the `spring.cloud.streamapp.security.enabled` and `spring.cloud.streamapp.security.csrf-enabled` properties control the application security behavior.

By default the security is enabled allowing unauthorized access only to the `Info` and `Health` endpoints.

The `spring.cloud.streamapp.security.enabled = false` completely surpass the application security.

For secured application setting `spring.cloud.streamapp.security.csrf-enabled = false` disables security for the CSRF access.

With security enabled (`spring.cloud.streamapp.security.enabled = true`) and `actuator` dependency on the classpath, the `ManagementWebSecurityAutoConfiguration` is activated, providing unauthenticated access to the `HealthEndpoint` and `InfoEndpoint`.

If the user specifies their own `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`, this configuration will back-off completely and the user should specify all the bits that they want to configure as part of the custom security configuration.

=== Configuration
To include app starters security management for a stream app, just include a dependency on this module.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud.stream.app</groupId>
    <artifactId>app-starters-security-common</artifactId>
</dependency>
----


All Spring Cloud Stream app starters that inherit form the `core` pom have the `app-starters-security-common` dependency included by default.

* `spring.cloud.streamapp.security.enabled` (default: `true`). If set to `false` it surpasses the boot security.
* `spring.cloud.streamapp.security.csrf-enabled` (default: `true`). If set to `false`, for secured applications it enables CQRS.
